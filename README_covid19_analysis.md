# 🌍 Global COVID-19 Trends: A Data-Driven Analysis of the Pandemic's Progression

This repository contains a complete data analysis and visualization project on the global progression of COVID-19 using Python. Built in Google Colab as part of the 3MTT Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization track, it demonstrates how real-world time series, geospatial, and interactive data can be processed and visualized end-to-end.
